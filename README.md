# Overview 

This course deepends in the knowledge in the are of parallel computing. Focus is set on shared-memory architectures, as current trends indicate an increasing use of such architectures. Initially, aspects of synchronization are explained and how they impact cache-coherent shared-memory architectures (locks, barriers). The following lectures pay attention to the snooping coherence, scalable coherence, foundations of consistency models and relaxed consistency models. Frequently, important research directions are reviewed and put into context with regard to commercially available solutions. In the context of research, of particular interest is transactional memory, token-basd coherence, and and non-uniform cache architectures. The course ends with a review of current CMOS trends and constraints, their implications, and a short review of deep learning as an emerging workload.
